# covid-support-app
A collaborative project creating an application to encourage online social interaction and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes the use of the Spotify and Google Maps APIs. The chosen development environment was React Native.

# Project Brief:

Working in groups of 4-5 you should develop an app to support society deal with Covid. This may be an app to help people protect themselves, manage their recovery, manage the lifestyle changes associated with the pandemic, manage mental health, support their exercise or caring duties or any other aspect of life that's affected. It may target the general population or a focussed group. This assessment is more open with considerable scope for individual group inventiveness. Development can be in any platform but support will be limited the further you venture from JavaScript, Android and React.

Your app may focus on support for individuals, for community groups, for sports groups or family/friendship groups. You may consider supporting one or more of the Five Ways to Wellbeing (see for example NHS Description):

- Connect with other people;
- Be physically active;
- Learn new skills;
- Give to others;
- Pay attention to the present moment (mindfulness).

The application should exploit mobile features such as sensors, location, and communication. It should support a range of devices and screen sizes. The application can be cross platform or platform specific but should run on Android and/or iOS. You can write the app using:

- HTML5, JavaScript6, and CSS;
- a cross-platform framework such as ReactNative, PhoneGap, or iOnic;
- a webview with Android and iOS wrappers;
- or an Android / iOS native app.
- Lab support is best for HTM5/JS then PhoneGap, Android, ReactNative with a need for self-investigation and learning when moving away from pure HTML5/JS. You may use any frameworks that help your development.  

The aim is to develop a prototype that shows key elements of your application but it does not have to be a full working application with some elements placeholder or simplified - you should simulate any aspects of the code that is not possible to develop within the project (i.e. communication with external hardware). You will, however, be marked on the extent of the development you have done.
