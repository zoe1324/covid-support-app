## Project Brief:

Working in groups of 4-5 you should develop an app to support society deal with Covid. This may be an app to help people protect themselves, manage their recovery, manage the lifestyle changes associated with the pandemic, manage mental health, support their exercise or caring duties or any other aspect of life that's affected. It may target the general population or a focussed group. This assessment is more open with considerable scope for individual group inventiveness. Development can be in any platform but support will be limited the further you venture from JavaScript, Android and React.

Your app may focus on support for individuals, for community groups, for sports groups or family/friendship groups. You may consider supporting one or more of the Five Ways to Wellbeing (see for example NHS Description):

* Connect with other people;
* Be physically active;
* Learn new skills;
* Give to others;
* Pay attention to the present moment (mindfulness).

The application should exploit mobile features such as sensors, location, and communication. It should support a range of devices and screen sizes. The application can be cross platform or platform specific but should run on Android and/or iOS. You can write the app using:

* HTML5, JavaScript6, and CSS;
* a cross-platform framework such as ReactNative, PhoneGap, or iOnic;
* a webview with Android and iOS wrappers;
* or an Android / iOS native app.
* Lab support is best for HTM5/JS then PhoneGap, Android, ReactNative with a need for self-investigation and learning when moving away from pure HTML5/JS. You may use any frameworks that help your development.  

The aim is to develop a prototype that shows key elements of your application but it does not have to be a full working application with some elements placeholder or simplified - you should simulate any aspects of the code that is not possible to develop within the project (i.e. communication with external hardware). You will, however, be marked on the extent of the development you have done.

## Register - Get Started
On the welcome screen our app has the option to register a new account if you do not already have one - providing us with your interests also so that the app can match you to others with the same interests on the Chat screen later:

## Home Screen - Socialise, Exercise, Discover Music and More
Here there are four different pages you can visit (see below) as well as a 'How are you feeling today?' button for user encouragement. I was responsible for creating and designing the homepage that links the app screens together. The username is displayed at the top next to our app logo which helps indicate who is logged in and acts as a personal greeting.

## Chat - Talk To Users With The Same Interests As You
You can start a conversation with anyone that has at least one of the same interests you registered with - as well as access your old/current chats:

## Map - You Are Here!
Our app shows your current location, so you can find local parks to go and exercise.

## Spotify - Find New Music!
Our app uses the Spotify API so that the user can log into their Spotify account, find out their favourite artist, and based on their choice of how that artist's music makes them feel, they can add a pre-made playlist to their Spotify account. The app also asks for permission to use your spotify details.
